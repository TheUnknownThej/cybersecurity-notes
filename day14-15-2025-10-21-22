**Progress:** Completed Modules 1 to 4  

**Learned About:**  
- Basics of programming (variables, data types, conditional and iterative statements)  
- Functions, modules, and libraries for code reusability  
- Working with strings and lists  
- Writing algorithms and using regular expressions for pattern searching  
- Reading, writing, and parsing files  
- Debugging code and automating file operations  

**Portfolio Project:**  
- *Update a File Through a Python Algorithm*  
  [View Project PDF](../python-projects/Exemplar%20-%20Update%20a%20file%20through%20a%20Python%20algorithm.pdf)  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Automated the process of updating an allow list by removing deprecated IP addresses from a text file.  
- Practiced using `open()`, `.read()`, `.split()`, and `.write()` to handle file data in Python.  
- Reinforced iteration and conditional logic within real-world scripting context.  
- Learned how automation reduces manual errors and improves security efficiency.
